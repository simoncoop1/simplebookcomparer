# Simple Book Comparer
Looks for the most frequent words in a book. To remove frequent words like 'the' etc, the words of a second book are negated from the first.

## To run

the main book should be called book1.txt and the second book should be called book2.txt. You can copy the example books in the repositiory

```
python3 frequentwords.py
```

alternatively spcify the filenames manually

```
python3 frequentwords.py --mainfile book1.txt --file2 book2.txt
```
